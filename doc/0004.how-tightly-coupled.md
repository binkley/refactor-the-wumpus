One of the interesting things about the dictionary is that a lot
of code only needs a slice, not the entire thing.

Furthermore, when we are testing whether or not the logic
handles use input correctly, we don't care at all about
the prompts that come out of the system.

It might be that we really have two different pieces - the
logical processing of inputs, with its internal state machine
and an understanding of the "events" that might result
from an input, and then a separate component that understands
how to translate those events into prompts.
